Building React Portfolio Website with AWS Serverless Services.

Domain Purchased: yadav-amit.com

Working on Template.

When S3 bucket was public and static site was enabled, the site was working fine. This was just for testing purpose.
I disabled this settings and only CloudFront url was working rather than my domain name. I was facing this since yesterday (10-23-2023).
